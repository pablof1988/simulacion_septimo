\title{Psedurandom Number Generator using the middle square method}
\usage{
Squaremean(seed, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{seed}{Integer initial value (the seed) that determines the starting
point of the sequence. It should have between 2 and 8 digits.}

\item{n}{Integer. Number of pseudorandom values to generate.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \code{n} containing the generated pseudorandom values.
}
\description{
Implements John von Neumannâ€™s *Middle Square Method* to generate a sequence
of pseudorandom numbers. In each iteration, the seed is squared, the middle
digits are extracted, and the result is normalized by dividing by \eqn{10^{d}},
where \eqn{d} is the number of digits in the original seed.
}
\details{
The Middle Square Method is one of the earliest pseudorandom number
generation algorithms. Although simple, it often produces short or cyclic
sequences and should mainly be used for educational or demonstration purposes.

At each step, the algorithm:
1. Squares the current seed.
2. Extracts the middle digits (same number of digits as the original seed).
3. Normalizes the result by dividing by \eqn{10^{d}}.
4. Uses this value as the new seed for the next iteration.

\examples{
# Generate 4 pseudorandom numbers from seed 4097
Squaremean(4097, 4)

# Try with other seeds
Squaremean(1324, 4)
Squaremean(6500, 4)
