\title{Binomial Random Number Generator}
\usage{
abinom(m, n, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{Number of random numbers to generate. Must be a positive integer.}

\item{n}{Number of trials in the binomial experiment. Must be a non-negative
integer (\\(n \\geq 0\\)).}

\item{p}{Probability of success on each trial. Must be in the interval
\\([0, 1]\\).}
}
\value{
An integer vector of length `m` with values between `0` and `n`,
  following a Binomial(\\(n, p\\)) distribution.
}
\description{
Generates a sample of `m` random numbers from a **Binomial distribution**
with parameters `n` (number of trials) and `p` (success probability) using
the **inverse transform method** on the cumulative distribution function (CDF).
This is an **exact method** — no approximation.

\examples{
set.seed(123)
x <- abinom(m = 10, n = 5, p = 0.3)
x
mean(x)  # approximately 1.5
var(x)   # approximately 1.05
