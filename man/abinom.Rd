\title{Binomial Random Number Generator}
\usage{
abinom(m, n, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{Number of random numbers to generate. Must be a positive integer.}

\item{n}{Number of trials in the binomial experiment. Must be a non-negative
integer (n >= 0).}

\item{p}{Probability of success on each trial. Must be between 0 and 1.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of length m with values between 0 and n,
  following a Binomial(n, p) distribution.
}
\description{
Generates a sample of m random numbers from a binomial distribution with
parameters n (number of trials) and p (success probability) using
the method on the cumulative distribution function (CDF).
This is an exact method — no approximation.
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
x <- abinom(m = 10, n = 5, p = 0.3)
x
mean(x)  # approximately 1.5
var(x)   # approximately 1.05
