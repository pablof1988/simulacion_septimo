\title{Test of Independence for Random Sequences}
\usage{
indeptest(x, lags)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A random sequence}

\item{lags}{The number of lags (autocorrelation terms) to include in the test statistic.}
}
\value{
The function returns the test statistic (Q), the degrees of freedom,
and the p-value of a chi-square test for serial independence based on
sample autocorrelations up to the specified number of lags.
}
\description{
This function performs a chi-square test of independence to evaluate
whether a given sequence of random numbers is independent.
The test compares the observed joint frequencies of successive pairs
in the sequence with the expected frequencies under the hypothesis
of independence between consecutive values.

The test is commonly used in the analysis of random number generators
to detect potential autocorrelation or dependence patterns in simulated data.
